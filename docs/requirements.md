## Software Requirements

In order to run the K-Link K-Search the following Software is needed:

- Operating system [supported by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/faq/#does-docker-run-on-linux-macos-and-windows) (we recommend GNU/Linux and we use [Debian](https://debian.org))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Storage

The K-Search requires 4GB of free space for the installation. This requirement is generated by the use of Docker images, which are serving the packaged code of the K-Search.

Depending on the configuration additional space on disk might be required.
